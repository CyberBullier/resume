    \textsl{President and Founder} \hfill \textbf{Sep 2011 -- present}\\
    Full stack software development for clients, with a focus on building
    server-side applications that integrate state-of-the-art NLP and
    machine learning. Notable projects include:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item A deep learning based conversational UI framework to power
      will.i.am's new wireless earphones and other applications. Backed by
      Python, Tensorflow, and other technologies. Supports multiple languages,
      extensible dialogue flows, and includes a type system that integrates with
      a custom knowledge base. Our software had a significant role in the
      success of the client's recent \$117M fundraising round
      (\url{https://goo.gl/iMvVTt}).
    \item An intelligent agent for a healthcare client that performs realtime
      conversational analysis from raw audio. Uses an open source library I
      built for training and serving machine learning models from Elixir
      (\url{https://github.com/cairn-labs/mlem}).
    \item A web-based business intelligence tool allowing decision-makers
      within the pharmaceutical industry to optimize total revenue of product
      launches across many countries. Backed by Elixir/Phoenix and React.js;
      includes a fast, concurrent traveling salesman problem solver.
    \item An advertising server to display appropriate concert ticket offers
      to users, based on user-level and page-level contextual targeting. Backed
      by Elixir/Phoenix, Python, PostGIS, and React.js.
    \end{itemize}

    A SaaS business intelligence product to help analysts enrich their customer
    data with geographic columns (latitudes/longitudes, ZIP codes, etc) and
    demographics. Processing is server-based but integrated with Microsoft
    Excel, Python, and the Domo platform: \url{www.cairngeographics.com}.

    \textbf{Google}, Venice, CA \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Software Engineer III} \hfill \textbf{Jun 2014 -- Mar 2016}\\
    Worked on a small team using natural language processing and other machine
    learning techniques to improve advertisement quality. Led a 20\% project
    related to mining semantic information from web data, which was adopted by
    several teams across different product areas. Built a named entity
    recognition system in C++ and a link detection algorithm that runs on very
    large graphs; contributed to a topic model for clustering semantic entities.

    \textbf{Whisper}, Venice, CA \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Software Engineer and Data Scientist} \hfill \textbf{Mar 2013 -- Apr 2014}\\
    Sole data scientist at a rapidly expanding social media startup
    seeing upwards of three billion monthly pageviews. Designed and built an NLP
    service to extract topics and tags from posts, predict image searchterms
    from unstructured text, and target content to users. Implemented a new
    geographic search system using PostGIS that decreased search time by
    90\%. Worked closely with the front and backend development teams, writing
    production code in Erlang and Python.
